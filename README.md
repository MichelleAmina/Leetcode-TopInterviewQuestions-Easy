### Buy and Sell Stock 
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

### Rotate Array 
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105
 

Follow up:

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


### Contain Duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109


### Single Number 
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
